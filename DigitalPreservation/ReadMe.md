*Imagine you have a pet goldfish named Finny. When you get Finny, you can't just put him in a bowl of water and forget about him. Just like how you need to feed Finny, clean his bowl, and make sure he's comfortable, taking care of special things games requires ongoing attention too. This is how we save important things like music, documents, videos and games in computers so we can enjoy them for a long time, even if we get new computers or gadgets!*

Welcome to Digital Preservation For 5 Year Olds a game where CHAT GPT has written common definitions for common terminology in the field of Digital Preservation as if talking to a 5 Year Old.

These are cards of terms and definitions, the catch being that ChatGPT was asked to generate the definition with the specific requirement that it must be understood by a five year old.

So far we have created Digital Preservation for 5 Year Olds, with Archives for 5 Year Olds and a Storage Media Expansion pack hopefully be released soon after.
These games could be used in the classroom as a student learning activity, in workshops as an ice breaker, or just for fun!
