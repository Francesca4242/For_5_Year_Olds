# For_5_Year_Olds
## Background
The For 5 Year Olds game series is a series of games meant to introduce basic concepts and practices in different areas of the archival and information professional field to beginners.
They are essentially flash cards of terms and definitions, the catch being that ChatGPT was asked to generate the definition with the specific requirement that it must be understood by a five year old.

So far we have created Digital Preservation for 5 Year Olds, with Archival Theory for 5 Year Olds and Conservation for 5 Year Olds to hopefully be released soon after.

These games could be used in the classroom as a student learning activity, in workshops as an ice breaker, or just for fun!

## Rules

There are three rule variations, but do feel free to experiment and suggest more!

### Standard Rules

This is ideal for groups of 1-8 but could have as many people as can have a discussion together.
* Each team gets a deck of term and definition cards.
* The teams discuss among its members and matches the terms with their corresponding definitions.
* The teams that matches all terms the fastest, or identifies most number of correct definitions, wins.

### Go Fish Rules

This format is for up to 5 people. Each person starts with 2 term cards and 2 definition cards. 
* Deal the players their cards as specified above and then shuffle together the rest of the cards into a draw pile.
* Players take turns around the table. For each turn, a player: Draw a card; Reveal a match, if any; Give a card to the person on their right.
* A player may only reveal one term-definition match each turn. Once revealed, set the pair aside.
* The player that has the most pairs matched wins.

### Community Rules

This is for up to 38 people. If there are less than 19 players, each person gets a random term and definition card. If there are more than 19 players, each person gets either a term or a definition card. If there are more than 9 players and there is an odd number, one or more players should be given multiple cards.
* Deal the players their cards as specified above.
* The players go around the venue and attempts to locate their cardâ€™s partner.
* Each player should end up with a partner or two, highlighting the collaborative nature of digital preservation.
* Everyone is a winner in this format, though prizes may be given to the fastest pairs.
