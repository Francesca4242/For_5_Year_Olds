# For_5_Year_Olds
## Background
The For 5 Year Olds game series is a series of games meant to introduce basic concepts and practices in different areas of the archival and information professional field to beginners.
They are essentially flash cards of terms and definitions, the catch being that ChatGPT was asked to generate the definition with the specific requirement that it must be understood by a five year old.

So far we have created Digital Preservation for 5 Year Olds, with Archival Theory for 5 Year Olds and Conservation for 5 Year Olds to hopefully be released soon after.

These games could be used in the classroom as a student learning activity, in workshops as an ice breaker, or just for fun!

## Contents

In this repository you can download the .pdf files to create this game yourself. You should find:
* Instruction Manual
* 24 Term Cards
* 24 Definition Cards
* 8 additional Term and Definition cards for large groups, and
* Templates for your own terms and definitions

## Rules

There are three rule variations, but do feel free to experiment and suggest more!

### Standard Rules

This is ideal for groups of 1-8 but could have as many people as can have a discussion together.
* Each team gets a deck of term and definition cards.
* The teams discuss among its members and matches the terms with their corresponding definitions.
* The teams that matches all terms the fastest, or identifies most number of correct definitions, wins.

### Card Passing Rules

This format is for up to 5 people. Each person starts with 2 term cards and 2 definition cards. 
* Deal the players their cards as specified above and then shuffle together the rest of the cards into a draw pile.
* Players take turns around the table. For each turn, a player: (1) Draws a card; (2) Reveal a match, if any; (3) Gives a card to the person on their right.
* A player may only reveal one term-definition match each turn. Once revealed, set the pair aside.
* The player that has the most pairs correctly matched wins. Emphasise how one incorrectly matched pair negatively impacts another pair.

### Community Rules

This is for up to 48 people. If there are less than 25 players, each person gets a random term and definition card. If there are 25 or more players, each person gets either a term or a definition card at random. If there is an odd number of players, one or more players should be given multiple cards.
* Deal the players their cards as specified above.
* The players go around the venue and attempts to locate their cardâ€™s partner.
* Each player should end up with a partner or two, highlighting the collaborative nature of digital preservation.
* Everyone is a winner in this format, though prizes may be given to the fastest pairs.

### Group Discussion Rules

This is great as a teaching tool. There is no limit to the number of participants in this format. You will need blank cards or pices of paper, and a marker.
* Pick if you want to use term or definition cards. Set the other set of cards aside.
* Draw a card and read it out loud to the group.
* Ask the group to write down the term, if you selected a definition (and vice versa), that they think is most appropriate for your card.
* Bring all answers together and select the one that you feel best matches your card. The winner gets to keep the card.
* The person with most cards at the end wins.

## Printing

The cards are made to be printable on A4 sheets. It is recommended that you use 250 gsm or thicker board paper for a better feel. You can also cold laminate the cards or put them in sleeves for durability.

Make sure to match the cards with the right card back. The cards can be distinguished by the "term" or "definition" icons.

## Make your own cards

There is a template available so that you can make your own cards. Terms use Minion Pro size 20 font while definitions use Helvetica size 10 font.
